TweetProcessor.py should be used to preprocess the tweet file before being given to vec.py

vec.py takes a particular feature(query), counts its occurences in the input file and stores the values in an output file.

addcolumns.py takes the values from an output file created by vec.py and adds those values in the specified column of a csv file.

Convert the csv file to arff by adding headers.
